Samples to illustrate features of the LangChain4j framework. Some of the examples come from the langchain4j-examples project on GitHub.

Feel free to use whatever code you find here. Some of the examples (like the RAG-related ones) will not work unless you add your own pdf files
for them to process. Eventually I'll add some publicly available pdfs for them to search, but I haven't done that yet.

The generated libretto for the opera "Whispers of the Lost Hartford" is located in the src/main/resources/libretto.md file, and in that same
directory you'll find images generated by DALL-E 3 for each scene.

Enjoy,

Ken Kousen
