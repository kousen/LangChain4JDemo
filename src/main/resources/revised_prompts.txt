Create a detailed image of a large, monstrous creature from the cosmic depths of imagination. This creature has a humanoid body with wings and the head of an octopus, complete with tentacles. Its face doesn't have discernible eyes but seems to be made entirely of writhing, unsettling appendages. The vastness and horror of this being are conveyed in the gloomy, underwater background, where it resides in the darkest depths, unseen by human eyes.
