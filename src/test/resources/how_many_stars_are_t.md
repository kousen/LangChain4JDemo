## Question: 
How many stars are there in the universe?


## Answer: 
Estimating the number of stars in the universe is a complex task, and different sources provide varying estimates based on recent observations and calculations. Here are the key points from the sources:

1. **European Space Agency (ESA) Estimate**:
   - Astronomers estimate there are about 100,000 million stars in the Milky Way alone.
   - Extrapolating to the universe, estimates range from 10^22 to 10^24 stars, though this is a rough calculation.

2. **Big Think Estimate**:
   - The Milky Way contains approximately 400 billion stars.
   - Multiplying this by the estimated 6 to 20 trillion galaxies in the universe would overestimate the number by a factor of hundreds to thousands.
   - A more accurate estimate, assuming ~99% of stars formed and accounting for stellar death, suggests there are about 2.14 sextillion (2.14 × 10^21) stars in the universe today.

3. **Space.com Estimate**:
   - The Sloan Digital Sky Survey estimated about 48 million stars in a third of the sky, roughly half of what was expected.
   - A 2016 Hubble Space Telescope deep-field image suggested about 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe.
   - Assuming an average galaxy has 100 million stars, this would put the total number of stars at about 2 × 10^23, though this is still an underestimate.

4. **Sky & Telescope Estimate**:
   - Astronomers estimate the observable universe has more than 100 billion galaxies, with each galaxy containing a diverse number of stars.
   - The current estimate for the total stellar population in the observable universe is roughly 70 billion trillion (7 × 10^22) stars, though this is dependent on telescope sensitivity and likely an underestimate.

5. **Astronomy.com Estimate**:
   - There are approximately 200 billion trillion stars in the universe, or 200 sextillion (2 × 10^23).

In summary, while the exact number is still uncertain, the most accurate and widely accepted estimates range from about 2.14 sextillion (2.14 × 10^21) to 2 × 10^23 stars, depending on the methods used and the assumptions made about star formation and death rates.
