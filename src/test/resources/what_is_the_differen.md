## Question: 
What is the difference between the
Perplexity Sonar online models and the
Perplexity Chat models?


## Answer: 
The main differences between the Perplexity Sonar online models and the Perplexity Chat models lie in their primary functionalities, context handling, and usage scenarios:

1. **Functionality**:
   - **Sonar Online Models**: These models are designed to provide real-time access to the internet and up-to-date information. They are optimized for dynamic environments that require online, timely information. They have a search-enhanced capability, which allows them to retrieve factual information from the internet.
   - **Chat Models**: These models, on the other hand, are tailored for chat applications and handle multi-turn conversations. They are optimized for cost-effective, responsive, and high-quality conversational use, with some versions handling up to 128K tokens.

2. **Context Handling**:
   - **Sonar Online Models**: They have a context window length of 127,072 tokens, which is generally used for retrieving and processing online data. The search subsystem of these models does not attend to the system prompt but can use it for instructions related to style, tone, and language of the response.
   - **Chat Models**: These models also have a context window length of 127,072 tokens but are specifically designed for chat interactions. They can handle longer, detailed interactions and are optimized for fluid conversations and access to up-to-date information.

3. **Usage Scenarios**:
   - **Sonar Online Models**: Best suited for applications requiring real-time data access and integration with search capabilities, such as dynamic information retrieval and factual grounding.
   - **Chat Models**: Ideal for chatbots, support systems, and any other application requiring multi-turn conversations and high-quality, responsive interactions.

4. **Pricing**:
   - The pricing structure for both types of models varies, with the online models generally having a fixed price per request ($5) and a variable price based on input/output tokens, while the chat models have a variable price per million tokens ($0.2-$1).

In summary, while both types of models are designed to provide advanced AI capabilities, the Sonar online models focus on real-time data access and search functionality, whereas the Chat models are optimized for multi-turn conversations and interactive applications.
